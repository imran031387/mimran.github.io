Reservoir is a drupal 8 powered back end for your front end and also a content repository also this supports JSON API and OAuth2 
out of the box so It's dead simple to use.  

### How to install Reservoir
The preferred way to install Reservoir is using our Composer-based project template. It's easy!

2. Create a Reservoir project with `composer`
   `$ composer create-project acquia/reservoir-project MY_PROJECT --stability=alpha`
3. In your webhost configuration, point `my-project.com` to `[MY_PROJECT]/docroot`   
4. Install Reservoir by going to `http://my-project.com`
